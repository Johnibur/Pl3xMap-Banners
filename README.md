# Pl3xMap-Banners

Pl3xMap-Banners is an addon to Pl3xMap that allows players to display their banners the same way you can see banners on the vanilla map. Players with the `pl3xmap.banners.admin` permission need to right-click with an open map in their main hand on a placed banner to make it visible. Left-clicking will make the banner disappear from the map. 

[Pl3xMap-Signs](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Pl3xMap-Signs) was used as a template for this addon.
